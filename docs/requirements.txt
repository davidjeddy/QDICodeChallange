For this coding challenge, we would like for you to build a simple contact manager web application. 
The app should have a list of contacts, allow the user to add new contacts and edit existing ones. 
These are the fields you will need to collect:

First Name
Last Name
Zip Code
City
State

To add to the challenge, you need the City & State fields to be populated from a dynamic client 
side web service call based on the Zip Code the user enters. 
This web service is located @ http://ziptasticapi.com/ .

While we prefer you use our primary language, Python, you can choose a language you are more comfortable with.

Since the app needs to display previously entered information, you will need to persist data to a database. 
We typically use what is available on Googleâ€™s cloud platform (MySQL & Datastore), but you could also 
use SQLite, PostgreSQL,...

We encourage you to commit to your repo early and often. This will help show the phases/flow of your 
development.  To get started fork the repository and when you are all done submit a pull request 
so we can review it.
